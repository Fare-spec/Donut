## Donut - Rust Recreation

This project is an attempt to recreate the popular `donut.c`, now written in Rust. The goal is to replicate the ASCII 3D rotating donut animation.

## Description

The original `donut.c` is a fun ASCII animation demo, simulating a 3D rotating donut. This Rust code follows the same basic principles, recreating the ASCII display and dynamic rotation, but with no professional aspirations.

## Installation

To install and run this project, use the following command:

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/Fare-spec/Donut.git --branch main
 Donut
